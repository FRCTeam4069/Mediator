Mediator
========

An FRC compliant server application that accepts json data and put them 
in a queue for delivery. 

Technically could be modified for any uses.. but really is kinda useless
other than to simplify development (skip server development)

Target platform: Linux

Requirement:
 
 - Flask
 - Gevent
 - Python 2.7
